## Task Manager API

### Description
This project is a simple Task Manager API. It is a project to apply my Laravel knowledge and to demonstrate my skills in this framework.

This Task Manager API allows you to register yourself as a user. After the verification of your email, you can create, update, delete, and list your tasks. The listing of tasks can be filtered by, e.g., status, and you can order them by, e.g., due date. You can not only create tasks for yourself but also attach them to other users.

### Installation
First, clone the repository. Then create a .env file. You can use the .env.example file as a template. You have to set the database connection. After that, you can run 'php artisan migrate' to create the database tables. If you want to seed the database with some test data, you can run 'php artisan db:seed'. All test users have the password 'password'. To run the application, you can use 'php artisan serve'.

### API Documentation
After you have started the application, you can access the API documentation at http://localhost:8000/api/documentation.
